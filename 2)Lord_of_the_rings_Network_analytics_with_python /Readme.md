 
# Lord of the Rings Network Analytics with Python

## Project Overview

This project applies network analysis techniques to the "Lord of the Rings" series using Python. The goal is to explore and analyze the relationships and interactions between characters in the series.

## Key Features

- **Network Construction**: Built a network graph representing characters and their interactions.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualized the network using various Python libraries.
- **Centrality Measures**: Analyzed key characters using centrality metrics.
- **Community Detection**: Identified communities and clusters within the network.

## Files

- `network_construction.py`: Script for building the network graph from the dataset.
- `visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for visualizing the network and its properties.
- `centrality_analysis.py`: Script for calculating centrality measures.
- `community_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for identifying communities within the network.

## Data

The dataset includes interactions and relationships between characters in the "Lord of the Rings" series. It is used to construct and analyze the network.
